# Project Description
This is a project which explores and analyzes a single dataset containing Life Expectancy and GDP from six different countries. This analysis gives us insight into two questions:
* _Is there an association between GDP and life expectancy?_
* _How does GDP and life expectancy differ between countries?_

# How to Properly Run on Your Local Machine
1. Create or ensure you have a [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) environment containing the package dependencies listed below
1. Run life_expectancy_gdp_report.ipynb using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) 

# Python Package Dependencies
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
